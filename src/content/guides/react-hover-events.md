React provides a simple way to handle hover events using state and event handlers, allowing you to dynamically change your UI based on user interaction.

Start by creating a state to track whether an element is being hovered:


```jsx
const [isHovered, setIsHovered] = useState(false);
```

Next, attach `onMouseEnter` and  `onMouseLeave` event handlers to your target element. These events will toggle the hover state:

```jsx
onMouseEnter={() => setIsHovered(true)}
onMouseLeave={() => setIsHovered(false)}
```

Once the hover state is set up, you can conditionally trigger any UI change based on that state. This could include displaying or hiding elements, changing styles, or showing tooltips:

```jsx
{isHovered ? (
  <div className="hover-content">
    I'm visible when the element is hovered!
  </div>
) : null}
```
